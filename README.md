# COSC 315 Assignment Starter

Welcome to COSC 315! Before you start in on your assignments, try running through the following to ensure you have a working environment to build off of.

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

## Getting Started

1. Using your a terminal opened at this starter project's root directory, start the Docker container.

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    # If the above throws an error, try: docker-compose up
    ```

2. After the above process completes, double check the name of your container by running the following:

    ```bash
    docker ps
    # The output will look something like this:
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE             COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS         PORTS     NAMES
    eb647d15a206   starter-cosc315   "/bin/sh -c 'while :â€¦"   10 seconds ago   Up 2 seconds             cosc315
    # Your container should have the name "cosc315"
    ```

3. Attach an interactive shell to your container with the following command:

    ```bash
    docker exec -it cosc315 /bin/bash
    ```

    If you're on **Windows**, you may need to run the following command instead:

    ```bash
    docker exec -it cosc315 //bin//bash
    ```

    If successful, your terminal should display something along the lines of `root@...`

4. Change your directory to the development folder mounted in the container:

    ```bash
    cd /cosc315
    ls
    # You should see something like the following
    > Dockerfile  README.md  docker-compose.yml  test.c
    ```

5. Compile and run `test.c` with the following:

    ```bash
    gcc test.c -o test.out && ./test.out
    # You should see something like the following
    > Hello C Programming!
    ```
